This document is limited to BGP PE-based VPNs as described in RFCs 4026, 4110, and 4364. This model is intended to be instantiated at the management system to deliver the overall service. It is not a configuration model to be used directly on network elements. This model provides an abstracted view of the Layer 3 IP VPN service configuration components. It will be up to the management system to take this model as input and use specific configuration models to configure the different network elements to deliver the service. How the configuration of network elements is done is out of scope for this document. This document obsoletes RFC 8049; it replaces the unimplementable module in that RFC with a new module with the same name that is not backward compatible. The changes are a series of small fixes to the YANG module and some clarifications to the text.},

@article{hu2020ears,
	Abstract = {Software-Defined Networking
(SDN) adapts logically-centralized control by
decoupling control plane from data plane and
provides the efficient use of network resources. However, due to the limitation of traditional routing strategies relying on manual configuration, SDN may suffer from link congestion
and inefficient bandwidth allocation among
flows, which could degrade network performance significantly. In this paper, we propose
EARS, an intelligence-driven experiential network architecture for automatic routing. EARS
adapts deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to
simulate the human methods of learning experiential knowledge, employs the closed-loop
network control mechanism incorporating with
network monitoring technologies to realize
the interaction with network environment. The
proposed EARS can learn to make better control decision from its own experience by interacting with network environment and optimize
the network intelligently by adjusting services
and resources offered based on network requirements and environmental conditions.
Under the network architecture, we design the
network utility function with throughput and delay awareness, differentiate flows based on
their size characteristics, and design a DDPGbased automatic routing algorithm as DRL decision brain to find the near-optimal paths for
mice and elephant flows. To validate the network architecture, we implement it on a real
network environment. Extensive simulation
results show that EARS significantly improve
the network throughput and reduces the average packet delay in comparison with baseline
schemes (e.g. OSPF, ECMP)},

	Abstract = {ROADMs: These devices are located within the network nodes, and they route chunks of optical spectrum among fiber directions, filtering, attenuating and amplifying the optical signals as they travel through.

This paper describes a next step in our development, a set of 1U  modules for building Flexgrid, Colorless, Directionless and Contentionless ROADM nodes in an open manner.

A fixed-grid ROADM  with NETCONF northbound control interface was introduced in 2016.

Components:
Wavelength Selective Switches (WSS)

A Colorless port is a client-facing port which can be reconfigured to carry any ``color'' (wavelength) of light.  
Directionless capability means that the signal passing through a given client port can be routed towards any line degree.

Spectrum Monitoring
PDs measure the intensity of light which is hitting the PD's active area.

Optical Channel Monitor (OCM). An OCM can be modeled as a serial combination of a filter, possibly tunable, followed by a photodiode. In a flexgrid ROADM, the OCM is typically also capable of flexgrid operation.

Amplification
The most common device used for amplification is an ErbiumDoped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA)

   o  The network element may proactively "call home" after being

      management system.

   o  The network element may access the network in a way that
      dynamically assigns it an IP address, but does not register its
      assigned IP address to a mapping service (e.g., dynamic DNS).

   o  The network element may be deployed behind a firewall that
      implements Network Address Translation (NAT) for all internal
      network IP addresses.

   o  The network element may be deployed behind a firewall that does
      not allow any management access to the internal network.

   o  The network element may be configured in "stealth mode", and thus
      does not have any open ports for the management system to connect
      to.

   o  The operator may prefer to have network elements initiate
      management connections, believing it is easier to secure one open
      port in the data center than to have an open port on each network
      element in the network.},
